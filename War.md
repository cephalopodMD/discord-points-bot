# War
### If a player tries to take too many points from another player. PBot will eventually prompt the user that their next action will “declare war” on the user they are targeting.
- Decline => Transaction :x:
- Accept => Transaction :heavy_check_mark:/ War :bomb:


## :guardsman: War :guardsman:
- A war puts the players at odds with each other, gives incentives for some sneaky plays and allows points to be given and taken on a more massive scale. 
- Point bonuses from war allow amounts that are given or taken to exceed the maximum points cap!!

## While in a war
- Using `@PBot` to `give` or `take` points from another player has special effects depending on the user you target.

    ### Giving
    - **Ally `give` to Ally** :love_letter: Amount given + 5-10% of given amount (Friendly bonus)
    - **Ally `give` to Enemy** :knife: Amount given + 50-100% of given amount (Backstab bonus)

    ### Taking

    - **Ally `take` from Ally** :knife: Amount taken + 50-100% (Backstab bonus)
    - **Ally `take` from Enemy** :smiling_imp: Amount taken + 25-30% (War bonus)

## Joining a war

All you have to do to join a war is give or take from a player who is already in a war with another player. When you `give` or `take` from a player in conflict you will join them or their enemy respectively. Gaining war bonuses and potential backstab bonuses.

## Backstab bonuses

Backstabbing an allied player can only be done once per war per player. A backstab bonus is a one shot chance to betray an alliance or an ally and get a big bonus to sway the tides of a war. Be careful though, backstabbing a player will immediately remove you from that alliance.

## Disbanding War

Wars will temporarily be "Disbanded" where all alliances formed will be resolved allowing the server to start fresh. Everyone's total points will stay intact. The schedule for disbanding wars is not on a set schedule and is left up to the developers.
